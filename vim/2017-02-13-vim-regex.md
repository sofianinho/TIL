## Some useful vim regex

1. Delete all the lines that contain a pattern
  ```
  # This deletes all the lines that contain ".pyc" somewhere
  # I used it to clean up an output of git show --stat
  :%s/\( .\+\)\.pyc\(.\+\)$//g
  ```

2. Delete blank lines (to have a compact content with no superfleous spaces/newlines)
  ```
  :g/^$/d
  ```
